# Welcome

[Karpenter][karpenter] is a [Kuberneters][kubernetes] autoprovisioner that
provides just-in-time Nodes for any cluster. This site documents the
[Cluster API][clusterapi] provider for Karpenter. Meaning that this
Karpenter is capable of managing Nodes on any Cluster API owned cluster.

This project is currently, as of summer 2024, an experimental proof of concept
for how Karpenter might integrate with Cluster API. The intention is for the Kubernetes
community to use this experiment for learning more about the design pattern, feature
gaps, and areas for improvement. With the ultimate goal being a standard release
cycle and production ready Karpenter Cluster API provider.
